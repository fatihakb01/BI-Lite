🧩 1. What Axios Interceptors Are and Why They’re Useful
An Axios interceptor lets you “intercept” every request or response before it’s actually sent or processed 
— so you can inject common logic globally instead of repeating it in every API call.
There are two main types:
- Request interceptors → run before the request leaves your app
- Response interceptors → run after the response comes back
